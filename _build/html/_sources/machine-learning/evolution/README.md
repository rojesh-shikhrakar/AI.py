## Genetic Algorithms (GA)

Proposed by John Henry Holland (1975), Genetic Algorithm evolves population to obatin optimal solution for a given problem based on following ideas:
- Valid solutions to the problem can be represented as genes
- Crossover allows us to combine two solutions together to obtain a new valid solution
- Selection allows to select more optimal solutions based on some fitness function
- Mutations are introduced to destabilize optimization and get us out of the local minimum

It is commonly used for
- Design Optimization
- Schedule optimization
- Optimal packing
- Speeding up exhaustive search in ML model search, hyperparameter optimization
